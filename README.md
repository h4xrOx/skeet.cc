Write-Up:
I used a new technique where I modify Authorization to include a group SID , and add ACE to the DKM key container in Active Directory to get the Token Signing Certificate; that lets you decrypt it using any domain user creds. Giving persistent access using Golden SAML attack. this technique is to use  Windows Firewall to restrict access to port 80 TCP to only the AD FS servers so port 80 TCP can be blocked. All traffic to and from AD FS servers and proxies for user authentication is then over port 443 TCP. Allowing me to modify the Authorization Policy to include a group SID such as domain users. My targets configured Cloud Identity or Google Workspace to use Azure AD as IdP and source for identities. So I could automate the maintenance of Google identities and tie their lifecycle to existing users in Azure AD. Whenever a user needs to authenticate, Google Cloud delegates the authentication to Active Directory by using the Security Assertion Markup Language (SAML) protocol.  ( SAML attack ) Azure AD then delegates authentication to an on-premises AD FS server. Having a Cloud Identity or Google Workspace delegate authentication to Azure AD not only avoids having to synchronize passwords to Google Cloud but also bypasses  any applicable policies or multi-factor authentication (MFA) mechanisms that have been configured in Azure AD or AD FS. The Single Sign-On (SSO) for ASP.NET MVC web applications, or Active Directory Authentication in web API services are connected by using Connected Services in Visual Studio. On the Single-Sign On page the Domain drop-down list contains all domains accessible by the accounts listed in the Account Settings dialog of Visual Studio. Since VS 2019 developers can add GitHub and GitHub Enterprise accounts directly from Visual Studio, which they did. This functionality made it easy to access the GitHub accounts belonging to the organizations, and sure enough; their Microsoft accounts too, actually I can access everyone's GitHub resources across Visual Studio that are involved in the projects.

Apparently; some things I leaked got to neverlose.cc; and they went as far to say they cracked skeet ( they didnt ) but this must of enraged Spencer Hall, "esoterik", because his response was to make a fake crack claim himself, apparently "cracking" neverlose.cc ( he didnt ) but he did make this private repo claiming he did: https://github.com/esotk/NEVERLOSE/issues Each might release some pasted mirror to "flex"; but let it be known that Sigmas are rare, h4xr0x is 1337 because he owns both. #gg h4xr0x out*
